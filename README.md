# Final-Game

Instructions are straighforward, simply click on buttons with the mouse
I got kind of stuck working on the nodes of the game, and I wish that I could better understand why they wouldn't work sometimes
I'd like to improve upon the code itself, as I think that it can be a lot better in regards to simplifying it
Next time, I want to get more solid ideas down, and experiment with them more
